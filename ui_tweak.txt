We have a working product, DJ. The "Brain" (Backend) and "Face" (Frontend) are talking, and the "Handshake" is solid.

To answer your question: **"Where do I touch it to make it mine?"**

Since we are using **Tailwind CSS + Shadcn/ui**, you don't write traditional CSS files. You have three "Control Centers" depending on how deep you want to go.

Here is your **Personalization Map**:

### **Level 1: The "Paint Job" (Colors & Fonts)**

* **Goal:** Change the blue buttons to purple, or the white background to dark grey, or make the corners rounder.
* **Where:** `frontend/src/index.css`

This file contains the "DNA" of your app. Shadcn uses **CSS Variables** here.
Look for lines like this:

```css
:root {
  --primary: 222.2 47.4% 11.2%;   /* The main color (currently dark blue) */
  --radius: 0.5rem;               /* How round the buttons are */
}

```

* **Hack:** If you change `--radius` to `1.5rem`, all your cards and buttons instantly become pill-shaped.
* **Hack:** If you want a "Teal" theme instead of Slate, you update the `--primary` HSL numbers here.

### **Level 2: The "Furniture Arrangement" (Layout)**

* **Goal:** Move the "Add Medicine" button to the left, make the input boxes bigger, or add your logo.
* **Where:** `frontend/src/App.tsx`

This is where 90% of your edits will happen. You simply change the **Tailwind Classes** inside the HTML.

**Example:**
Right now, your "Generate PDF" button is blue:

```tsx
<Button className="bg-blue-600 hover:bg-blue-700 ...">

```

Change it to emerald green instantly:

```tsx
<Button className="bg-emerald-600 hover:bg-emerald-700 ...">

```

### **Level 3: The "LEGO Bricks" (Components)**

* **Goal:** You want *every* input box in the entire app to have a thick border, or *every* button to have a shadow.
* **Where:** `frontend/src/components/ui/...`

You will see files like `button.tsx`, `input.tsx`, `card.tsx`.
If you edit `button.tsx`, **every single button** in your app updates automatically. This is the power of React components.

### **Try This Experiment (Instant Rebranding)**

Let's make it look less "Generic Medical" and more "Tejas Tech."

**Open `frontend/src/App.tsx` and find the Header section.**
Replace the `<div>` that holds the title with this "Dark Mode" aesthetic code:

```tsx
{/* HEADER */}
<div className="flex justify-between items-center bg-slate-900 p-6 rounded-2xl mb-8 shadow-2xl">
  <div>
    <h1 className="text-3xl font-extrabold text-transparent bg-clip-text bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-400 to-emerald-400 tracking-tight">
      OneStopMed ⚡
    </h1>
    <p className="text-slate-400 font-mono text-sm mt-1">v1.0 // Dr. Tejas Protocol</p>
  </div>
  <Button variant="outline" className="border-slate-700 text-slate-300 hover:bg-slate-800 hover:text-white">
    System Settings
  </Button>
</div>

```

**Save it.** You will instantly see how just changing `className` transforms the vibe from "Clinic" to "Cyberpunk."

### **What is Next?**

You can tweak the UI forever (it's addictive), but we have a major milestone left.
We have a list of drugs, but clicking "Generate PDF" does nothing.

**Are you ready to start PHASE 3: THE ARTIFACT (PDF Generation)?**
This is where we make the actual file the doctor gives to the patient.
